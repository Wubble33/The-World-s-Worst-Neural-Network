BEHOLD! The worst (definitly the most useless) neural network of all time!

After trianing the AI on a few thousand numbers, it will be able to detect wich number you put into the system.
For years, programmers have alwyas wondered what four is equal to. Now, with the power of this AI, We can finally determine that four is actually equal to four! GENIUS!!!!!!

(if you are wondering, I just wanted to make something quickly with TF without just following instructions word to word and this was by far the easiest way to do it)
